> A project that demonstrates how **Segment Trees** can optimize aggregate queries in a simulated database system. This project supports a basic CRUD operation database and optimizes queries such as **sum**, **min**, and **max** using **Segment Trees** with added support for the `WHERE` clause.

### ðŸ§  **Key Features**
- **Database Simulation**: Implements CRUD operations using **B-Trees**.
- **Optimized Querying**: Uses **Segment Trees** to perform aggregate queries like `SUM`, `MIN`, `MAX`, etc.
- **Advanced Query Handling**: Extends functionality to handle SQL-like `WHERE` clauses.
- **Fast Query Processing**: Efficient querying using **Binary Search** and **Segment Trees**.
